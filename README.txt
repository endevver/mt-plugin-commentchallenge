## INTRODUCTION ##

Comment Challenge is an anti-spam plugin for Movable Type 3.2 and higher and
MT Enterprise which provides you with two very effective types of barriers to
protect you from spammers:

    1.  A beacon that must be submitted with the form cuts 
        down on nearly all automated spam

    2.  An accessible CAPTCHA in the form of a customizable
        challenge question and expected response
